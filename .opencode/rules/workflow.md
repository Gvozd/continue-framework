# Development Workflow

## Source Control

This project does **not** use pull requests or merge requests — commits land directly on the working branch. Never offer to open a PR/MR or invoke a platform's PR/MR CLI, and never reference "the PR description" as a place for context. Commit messages are the only review surface; put the *why* there.

**This project's commit discipline overrides any tool-level default that restricts commits to explicit user requests only.** The TDD workflow requires automatic commits after each phase (red, green, refactor) — they are an integral part of the development cycle, not discretionary actions.

## Lifecycle

Every story follows: **interview → spec → backend scenarios → integration scenarios → frontend scenarios → security scenarios → load scenarios → infrastructure scenarios**.

**High-level progress** is tracked in `ProductSpecification/stories.md` — three tables: **In Progress**, **Backlog**, and **Done**. Phase columns (Spec, Backend, Integration, Frontend, Security, Load, Infra) per story. The `/continue` skill updates it after each work unit commit. Phase values: ✅ done, 🔧 in progress, — not started, · no story folder yet. When a story reaches 100% (all scenarios done), move its row from the **In Progress** table to the **Done** table.

**Backlog** stories have all `·` columns (no folder yet). When `/continue N` targets a Backlog story, auto-promote it: move the row from **Backlog** to **In Progress** in `ProductSpecification/stories.md` before starting work.

Spec phase: `/interview` → `/story` → `/mockups` → `/api-spec` → `/test-spec` (one at a time, review each before proceeding).

## Backend Scenario Sequence

For each scenario in `tests/01_API_Tests.md`:

1. `red-acceptance` → `/red-acceptance` → `/test-review` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → commit
2. `design` → `/design-preview` → user approves (optionally with ADR) or escalates to `/architecture` → commit (if ADR produced)
3. `red-usecase` → `/red-usecase` → `/test-review` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → commit
4. `green-usecase` → `/green-usecase` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → `/test-coverage usecase --focus` → commit
5. `adapters-discovery` → adapter discovery: identify ports and map to adapters, mark `[x] adapters-discovery`, insert concrete `red-adapter X` / `green-adapter X` steps below it (or `[S]` if no new adapters), commit progress.md
6. `red-adapter X` → `/red-adapter X` → `/test-review` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → commit (one per port)
7. `green-adapter X` → `/green-adapter X` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → `/test-coverage {adapter} --focus` → commit (one per port)
8. `green-acceptance` → `/green-acceptance` → commit

The `[ ] adapters-discovery` checkbox is a gate — it must be resolved before any subsequent step executes. The full procedure is in `.opencode/templates/workflow/adapter-discovery-checklist.md`.

## Integration Scenario Sequence

For each scenario in `tests/06_Integration_Tests.md` (if exists): same TDD cycle as backend scenarios above. Integration scenarios cover cross-cutting concerns: scheduled jobs, webhook idempotency, resilience, and email triggers.

## Frontend Scenario Sequence

For each scenario in `tests/02_UI_Tests.md`:

1. `red-selenium` → `/red-selenium` → `/test-review` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → commit
2. `red-frontend` → `/red-frontend` → `/test-review` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → commit
3. `green-frontend` → `/green-frontend` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → commit
4. `red-frontend-api` → `/red-frontend-api` → `/test-review` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → commit
5. `green-frontend-api` → `/green-frontend-api` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → commit
6. `align-design` → Build component → `/align-design` → `/design-review` (MANDATORY) → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → `/align-design` verify-only → `/test-coverage frontend --focus` → commit
7. `green-selenium` → `/run-backend` → `/run-frontend` → `/green-selenium` → commit
8. `demo` → `/demo {test_class}` → progress-only commit


## Security Scenario Sequence

For each scenario in `tests/05_Security_Tests.md` (if exists): same TDD cycle as backend scenarios above. Security scenarios cover OWASP concerns: injection, XSS, CSRF, rate limiting, mass assignment, and input validation.

## Load Scenario Sequence

For each scenario in `tests/03_Load_Tests.md` (if exists): same TDD cycle as backend scenarios above. Load scenarios cover performance and volume concerns: response time baselines, concurrent request handling, and large data set behavior.

## Infrastructure Scenario Sequence

For each scenario in `tests/04_Infrastructure_Tests.md` (if exists): same TDD cycle as backend scenarios above. Infrastructure scenarios cover resilience concerns: database failure handling, recovery after outages, and external service unavailability.

## Infrastructure & Port Configuration

Moved to `.opencode/rules/infrastructure.md` (rules) and `.opencode/tech/{backend}/templates/infrastructure/infrastructure-details.md` (full details).

## Progress Tracking

Each story has a progress file: `ProductSpecification/stories/NN-story-name/progress.md`.

### Status Markers

- `[x]` — done
- `[~]` — in-progress (current step)
- `[ ]` — pending
- `[S]` — skipped

### Reading Progress

When the user says "continue working on story X" or runs `/continue X`:
1. Read `ProductSpecification/stories/NN-story-name/progress.md`
2. Find the first `[ ]` or `[~]` entry — that is the next work unit
3. Report current status and what step will execute next

### Updating Progress

After completing a work unit:
1. Change `[~]` to `[x]` for the completed step
2. Change the next `[ ]` to `[~]` if continuing
3. Commit the progress file with the work unit commit

### Bootstrapping

If no `progress.md` exists, create one by:
1. Detecting spec artifacts in the story directory:
   - `interview`: check if `interview.md` exists
   - `story`: check if `NN_StoryName.md` exists
   - `mockups`: check if `mockups/` has files
   - `api-spec`: check if `endpoints.md` exists
   - `test-spec`: check if `tests/01_API_Tests.md` exists
   - **Edge case**: if all spec items exist EXCEPT `interview.md`, mark `[S] interview (spec completed without interview)` — don't force retroactive interviews on old stories
2. Reading the story's test specs (`tests/01_API_Tests.md`, `tests/06_Integration_Tests.md` if exists, `tests/02_UI_Tests.md`, `tests/05_Security_Tests.md` if exists, `tests/03_Load_Tests.md` if exists, `tests/04_Infrastructure_Tests.md` if exists)
3. Scanning existing test classes and production code for completed steps
4. Marking completed steps as `[x]`, next step as `[~]`, rest as `[ ]`
5. For backend/integration/security scenarios, **always include `design` after `red-acceptance`** — it is mandatory for every scenario that needs new implementation. Only omit it when the entire scenario is `[S]` (existing implementation covers everything). Include `[ ] adapters-discovery` after `green-usecase` — adapter discovery runs when this step is reached.
6. For frontend scenarios, include `demo` as the final step per scenario

## Atomic Work Units

A work unit is indivisible: ALL sub-skills in the dispatch sequence (primary skill → test-review → test-coverage → refactor → commit) must execute to completion before stopping. Within a work unit, never pause between sub-skills to report status or ask for confirmation. But after the commit that concludes the work unit, STOP — do not continue to the next work unit. The only valid stop points are: (1) after the commit, (2) on sub-skill failure. If a sub-skill fails, stop immediately and report — but a successful sub-skill must be followed by the next sub-skill in the sequence without interruption.

## Resuming Across Conversations

`progress.md` is the single source of truth for **state** — a new conversation reads it to know which work unit runs next. It does not capture the *why*: predictions that did not match, decisions made in discussion, surprises in existing code, approaches that failed. That context is lost when the user runs `/clear` or `/compact`.

**Journey summaries** preserve the why. They are written by the `/handoff` skill and read by `/continue` on resume — `/handoff` is the sole writer, `/continue` only reads. Run `/handoff` the moment you observe one of these worth-noting moments during work, rather than waiting for the end of the conversation; run it again before `/clear` or `/compact` as a final sweep. Do not spam it: `/handoff` fires only on a genuine trigger — a prediction mismatch, a decision reached in discussion, a surprise, a mistake worth not repeating, a quirk a future scenario will hit (the authoritative list is in `.opencode/templates/workflow/summary-format.md` — "When to Write"). Never run it for routine progress that a future session can derive from `progress.md`, the commit, or the code. It is a targeted capture, not a periodic checkpoint. Capturing noteworthy material as it happens is why `/handoff` writes and `/continue` does not — the signal lives in the discussion and debugging, not in the work-unit artifacts. Because `/handoff` may run many times per conversation, it is idempotent: before appending it checks the summary file and skips any entry already recorded.

Summary files are append-only and created lazily: if a conversation had nothing noteworthy, no file is written, and "nothing to record" is a valid, common outcome. When a scenario's last step commits, `/handoff` promotes enduring codebase quirks to `carryover.md` at the story root so later scenarios inherit them.

See the `/handoff` and `/continue` skills for the mechanics (file layout, carryover promotion, reading on resume) and `.opencode/templates/workflow/summary-format.md` for when to write an entry and the strict entry format.

# Task Workflow

Tasks are standalone work items that don't need the full story lifecycle. Three types:

- **bug** — Something is broken. Discover root cause first, then fix with a targeted TDD cycle.
- **refactoring** — Structural improvement. User-defined steps with standard TDD sub-skills.
- **qa** — Manual checklist (smoke / regression) verified against an external environment. No production code change, no TDD cycle.

Tasks live in `ProductSpecification/tasks/{N}-{type}-{slug}/`. Each task has a progress file at that path. When all checkboxes in a task's `progress.md` are `[x]` (or `[S]`), the task folder is moved to `ProductSpecification/tasks/done/`.

Bug and refactoring tasks follow the same TDD discipline as stories: `/test-review` after red phases, `/refactor` after every phase (except `green-acceptance`, `green-selenium`, `demo`). Task commits use `task:` prefix. Tasks don't need bootstrapping -- `/task` generates everything at creation time.

## Bug Task Sequence (Discovery-First)

Bug tasks do NOT pre-plan TDD steps at creation time. The cause is usually unknown when the task is filed -- planning a full red/green/refactor sequence up front commits to assumptions that turn out wrong. Instead, every bug starts with discovery:

1. `reproduce in prod-copy` (prod-copy bugs only) — manually reproduce the bug in the prod-copy environment, confirm symptoms match the report, capture any unexpected behavior; progress-only commit
2. `root cause analysis` — locate the defect in the codebase, document findings (extend `spec.md` if the cause differs from the original write-up); progress-only commit
3. `steps discovery` — based on the root cause, determine which layers the fix touches and insert concrete TDD steps below this gate (`red-*`, `green-*`, `align-design`, `demo`, etc.); commit progress.md

The `[ ] steps-discovery` checkbox is a gate -- it must be resolved before any subsequent TDD step executes. It is the bug-task analog of `[ ] adapters-discovery` in story scenarios.

**Why `reproduce in prod-copy` is a separate step:** prod-copy reproduction often surfaces details the original reporter omitted (exact field length, browser, sequence of actions, network response). Doing it before root-cause analysis prevents wasted investigation on the wrong code path.

**Refactoring tasks are unaffected** by the discovery sequence — their steps are user-defined from the spec interview, since the scope is structural and known up front.

**Scoped steps (refactoring + story scenarios only):** Progress should only include TDD steps for layers the fix actually touches. If the fix is pure CSS, don't generate logic/API/align-design steps. If the fix is backend-only, don't generate frontend steps. Affected layers are determined from the spec at creation time. For bug tasks, layer scoping happens at `steps discovery`, not at creation.

## QA Task Sequence

QA tasks define a reusable manual checklist verified against an external environment (prod-copy, staging). Their lifecycle differs from bug/refactoring tasks in three ways:

- **No TDD, no dispatch.** `progress.md` checkboxes are not work units — each is a manual verification step performed by a human in a browser. `/continue` does NOT auto-dispatch QA cases; on a QA task it reports the next unchecked case and reminds the tester to run it by hand.
- **Session lifecycle.** `spec.md` is the immutable checklist definition (Cases section). `progress.md` mirrors those cases as `[ ]` checkboxes for the active test session. The tester ticks them as cases pass. To re-run for a new deploy, revive the task from `done/` and reset checkboxes — never edit `spec.md` to track sessions.
- **Failures file separate bug tasks.** When a case fails during a session, the checkbox stays `[ ]` and the tester creates a separate `/task bug` (prod-copy variant if reproduced there) for the failure. Never overload the checkbox with a fail marker — `[x]` means verified, `[ ]` means not yet verified or under investigation.

Commits use the `task:` prefix like other task types. Multiple cases may be ticked in a single commit (a smoke session is not work-unit-atomic the way TDD is).

Operational details: `/task` skill (creation, sections, progress format), `/continue` skill (execution, dispatch, adapter discovery, steps discovery).
